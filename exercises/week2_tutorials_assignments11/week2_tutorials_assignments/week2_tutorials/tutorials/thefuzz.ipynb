    "Sometimes a dataset may include typos. Let's consider the following DataFrame that shows restaurant reviews given by some people:\n",
    "|name|review|\n",
    "|----|------|\n",
    "|Jussi|good|\n",
    "|Mary|terrible|\n",
    "|Alex|excellent|\n",
    "|Johanna|god|\n",
    "|Lauri|exellent|\n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily realize there should be three categories in reviews: \"good\", \"terrible\", and \"excellent\", while \"god\" and \"exellent\" are clearly typos. We can of course manually fix the typos but it makes more sense to automate the process, since there is no guarantee that we won't see other typos when we receive more reviews. One popular choice in correcting typos is to use fuzzy string matching. This is where [TheFuzz](https://github.com/seatgeek/thefuzz) library comes into the play. TheFuzz can be used to calculate the similarity of strings $a$ and $b$ using the Levenshtein similarity ratio\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{|a|+|b|-\\text{lev}(a,b)}{|a|+|b|},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $|a|$ and $|b|$ are string lengths and $\\text{lev}(a,b)$ is the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance). In the TheFuzz library, this ratio is named \"simple ratio\" and used to calculate a \"similarity score\". This similarity score is scaled to be a number between 0-100, where 100 signals maximal similarity (identical strings). \n",

    "Let's now use the TheFuzz library to correct the typos in the DataFrame. "
